Wyoming University Radiosondes Observations:
A GNU/Octave & MATLAB Automatic fetch and storage interface for Radiosonde data provided by the public repository hosted by the University of Wyoming.
This repository has been mainly developed and intensily used with GNU/Octave v4.4.0 under Linux OpenSuse distribution. Some testing has been done for Matlab R2016a (the one I have at office).
This function allows to download Radiosond data from any station listed at the Wyoming site. It is specially suitable to download large data sets from long time spans automatically and store it as NetCDF, MAT-file (default) or CSV data formats. Also includes a script to quickly plot the database.
