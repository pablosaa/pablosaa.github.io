HATPRO Data Binary Input Output (HATPRO-DaBinIO) is a C++ library to read, process and write binary data files from Humidity and Temperature Profiler radiometer by Radiometer Physics GmbH. This library is being developed under the OBLO project (Off-shore Boundary Layer Observatory) at the Geophysical Institute in Bergen, Norway.

DaBinIO is mean to be used to access raw binary data files, perform processing or filtering data and then save it as original raw data files to be utilized by HATPRO's firmware. The library is also used to read data directly to alternative retrieval alghorithms, furthermore due to its speed it is specially suitable to data assimilation schemes.

The library is implemented in bindings for MATLAB/GNU Octave and Julia (limited) under GNU Linux and MS Windows OS.
