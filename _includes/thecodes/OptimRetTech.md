Fortran 90 code for the Integrated Profiling Technique applied to retrieve Atmospheric variables as temperature, water vapor, liquid water profiles from microwave radiometer and ancillary data from radio sounds. I wrote this code based on a IDL script by Uli Loehnert at the University of Munich (now at the University of Cologne). The code is not developed by me anymore but people from Uni Cologne have been actively used and adapted for further applications.
