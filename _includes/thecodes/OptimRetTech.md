Fortran 90 code for Optimal Estimation Technique applied to retrieve temperature and water vapor profiles from microwave radiometer and ancillary data from radio sounds. I wrote this code based on a IDL script by Uli Loehnert at the University of Munich (now at the University of Cologne). The code is not developed by me anymore but people from Uni Cologne have been actively used adapted to other sensors.
