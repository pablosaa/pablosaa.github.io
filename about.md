title: About me
---
<p>
I'm a research scientist
at the <a alt="Alma Mater" href="https://uni-bonn.de">University of Bonn</a>
in Germany, where I did my Ph.D. on the remote sensing of the Atmosphere.<br/>
My research ranges from ground-based microwave remote sensing of the atmosphere, inversion techniques,
synergy of active and passive sensors, to the satellite-based remote sensing of soil moisture of Earth's surface.
Currently I'm mostly working with the development of SMOS/SMAP synthetic measurements for data assimilation studies, and ground validation of retrieved precipitation parameters by the GPM satellite.<br/>
I also enjoy the work with scientific instrumentation in the Lab or field
experiments, mainly with radiometers, radars and lidars.
<br/>
</p>
<p> Among my research interest are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Precipitating Clouds and Microphysics,</li>
  <li> Microwave Passive Radiometry and Passive-Active sensors synergy,</li>
  <li> Inversion Methods for Estimation of Atmospheric Parameters,</li>
  <li>  Processing and Validation for GPM, SMOS, SMAP Satellites Retrievals,</li>
  <li> Effects of Cloudiness on UV Radiation.</li>
</ul>
As part of my research work, I'm also developing scientific software for data-processing/ -analysing within the open source framework.
