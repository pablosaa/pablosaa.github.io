title: About me
---
<p>
I'm an research scientist
at the <a title="Alma Mater" href="https://uni-bonn.de">University of Bonn</a>
in Germany, which is also my <em>Alma mater</em> where I have obtained the Ph.D. on the remote sensing of the Atmosphere.<br/>
Formerly I got the degree in Physics from the <a title="Alma Mater Fisica" href="http://www.fiumsa.edu.bo">Carrera de Fisica</a>, Univerisity <em>Mayor de San Andres</em> in Bolivia.

Currently I'm mostly working with the development of SMOS/SMAP synthetic measurements for data assimilation studies, and ground validation of retrieved precipitation parameters by the GPM satellite. But my research ranges from ground-based microwave remote sensing of the atmosphere, inversion techniques, synergy of active and passive sensors.<br/>
I also enjoy the work with scientific instrumentation in the Lab or field
experiments, mainly with radiometers, radars and Lidars.<br/>
</p>
<p> Among my research interest are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Precipitating Clouds and Microphysics,</li>
  <li> Microwave Passive Radiometry and Passive-Active sensors synergy,</li>
  <li> Inversion Methods for Estimation of Atmospheric Parameters,</li>
  <li>  Processing and Validation for GPM, SMOS, SMAP Satellites Retrievals,</li>
  <li> Effects of Cloudiness on UV Radiation.</li>
</ul>
I'm also developing scientific software for data-processing/ -analysing within the open source framework.<br/>

PS. <em>I'm still trying to keep my old websites in the following links:
<a title="2010-2017 MIUB website" href="{{site.PDFmiub}}" target="\_blank">(2010-2016 website)</a>, and
