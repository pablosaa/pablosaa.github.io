I"þ<p>A satellite simulator alike SMOS or SMAP. Using CLM as land surface model for input and CMEM as L-band radiative transfer model.
The code takes into account satellite sensor information to assess sensing features as incidence angles, footprint, field-of-view, etc.
The radiative transfer model CMEM has been extended to take into account multiple incidence angles, using topography information to estimate
terrain slope and aspect which are used to calculate an effective incidence angle for the model.</p>
