<p>A <em>MATLAB/(GNU)Octave</em>  MEX function written in C++ to process L1C scientific data products from the MIRAS interferometer on board of the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite.</p>

<p>The L1C data product comes with data for brightness temperature at L-band in dual-polarization or full-polarization (4 Stokes
vector) mode, multiple incidence angle and at antenna reference frame.</p>

<p>The MEX-function processes the data for converting it to Earthâ€™s surface reference frame, at fixed bins incidence angles and full polarization.</p>
